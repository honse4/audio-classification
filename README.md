# audio-classification

This repository contains assignment work for an audio processing university course. The data was stored in Google Drive and the code was made in Google collab, but the final trained model can be accessed with the two pkl files(another jupyter notebook has code to run it). The report details all the steps taken and the justification for them, while also providing information about the nature of the data, the model used and a few methods of trying to use features in the audio to classify audio data.
